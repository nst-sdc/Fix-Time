        <strong>ðŸ§  The Problem:</strong> Every day, millions of people lose valuable time waiting in queues. In India alone, over <strong>99 million</strong> individuals spend more than <strong>3 hours daily</strong> standing in lines â€” totaling a staggering <strong>297 lakh hours</strong> of lost productivity every single day.

        Whether it's patients waiting outside hospitals from early morning just to get a token, or customers walking away from local salons due to visible queues â€” time is wasted, appointments are missed, and efficiency is lost.
